# gcmp - Git Compare on Steroids

`gcmp` (Git Compare) is a powerful command-line script that leverages Beyond Compare (or other graphical diff tools) to visually compare any two "areas" within a Git repository. It seamlessly combines the flexibility of `git diff` with the user-friendliness of a GUI tool, dramatically improving the efficiency of code reviews and change analysis.

## ‚ú® Core Features

*   **Intuitive Keywords**: Use simple keywords like `work`, `stage`, and `stash` to represent the working directory, staging area, and the latest stash.
*   **Full-Spectrum Comparison**: Supports comparison between the **Working Directory**, **Staging Area**, **Stash**, and any **commit, branch, or tag**.
*   **Smart Labeling**: Automatically generates clean labels for the comparison sources (e.g., branch names or `work`) and displays them in the diff tool's title bar and temporary directories for clarity.
*   **Directory-Level Diffing**: Exports the state of your Git areas into full directory trees, giving you a high-level overview of all file changes.
*   **Highly Customizable**: Easily switch the default `bcompare` to your favorite diff tool (like `kdiff3`, `meld`, `vscode`, etc.).
*   **Safe and Reliable**: All operations are performed in temporary directories that are automatically cleaned up on exit, never polluting your workspace.

## ‚ùì Why use `gcmp`?

Standard `git diff` is powerful, but its terminal-based, file-by-file output can make it difficult to grasp the big picture for large or scattered changes.

`gcmp` solves the following pain points:

1.  **The Big Picture**: Want to know exactly which files were changed, added, or deleted in `feature-A` compared to `main`? `gcmp` presents this clearly as a directory tree.
2.  **Simplified Complex Comparisons**: An operation like `git diff work stage` doesn't exist natively. But `gcmp work stage` makes it trivial, clearly showing which changes in your working directory have not yet been staged with `git add`.
3.  **GUI Advantage**: For complex changes within a single file, a GUI tool's side-by-side scrolling, syntax highlighting, and inline diffs are far more intuitive than the `+` and `-` lines in a terminal.

## üöÄ Installation

We recommend placing the `gcmp` script in your system's `PATH` for easy access from any repository.

### Quick Install (Recommended)

Run the following command in your terminal to automatically download the script, grant permissions, and move it to `/usr/local/bin`.

```bash
# Download the script
curl -o gcmp https://raw.githubusercontent.com/path/to/your/script/gcmp.sh
# Grant execute permissions
chmod +x gcmp
# Move it to a directory in your PATH (may require sudo)
sudo mv gcmp /usr/local/bin/gcmp
```
> **Note**: Please replace the `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/...` URL with the actual raw URL of your script.

### Manual Install

1.  Save the script's code as `gcmp.sh` or simply `gcmp`.
2.  Give it execute permissions in your terminal: `chmod +x gcmp`.
3.  Move this file to a directory included in your `PATH` environment variable, such as `~/bin` or `/usr/local/bin`.

## üí° Usage

### Basic Syntax

```
gcmp [repo_path] <ref1> <ref2>
```

*   `repo_path` (Optional): The path to the Git repository. If omitted, the current directory is used.
*   `<ref1>` & `<ref2>`: The two Git references or keywords to compare.

### Special Keywords

This is the core magic of `gcmp`, making complex comparisons simple.

| Keyword | Represents Git Area | Description                                                  |
|:--------|:--------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `work`  | Working Directory   | All tracked files as they currently exist in your workspace. |
| `stage` | Staging Area (Index)| Content that has been added with `git add` for the next commit. |
| `stash` | The Latest Stash    | Represents `stash@{0}`, your most recent stash.              |

In addition to these keywords, `<ref1>` and `<ref2>` can be any reference Git understands (a "commit-ish"), such as:
*   **Commit HASH**: `abc123d`, `7a4e3f81`
*   **Branch Name**: `main`, `my-feature`
*   **Tag Name**: `v1.0.2`
*   **Relative Ref**: `HEAD`, `HEAD~2`, `main~1`
*   **Other Stashes**: `'stash@{1}'` (note the quotes)

### Common Examples

---

#### 1. Compare Working Directory vs. Staging Area
*See what changes haven't been staged yet*
```sh
gcmp work stage
```
**It answers:** "What changes will be added to the index if I run `git add .` right now?"

---

#### 2. Compare Staging Area vs. Last Commit
*Preview what you are about to commit*
```sh
gcmp stage HEAD
```
**It answers:** "What will the snapshot look like if I run `git commit` right now?" (This is the graphical equivalent of `git diff --staged`)

---

#### 3. Compare Working Directory vs. Last Commit
*See all local changes since the last commit (both staged and unstaged)*
```sh
gcmp work HEAD
```
**It answers:** "What have I changed since my last commit?" (This is the graphical equivalent of `git diff HEAD`)

---

#### 4. Compare Latest Stash vs. Current Branch
*Decide whether to `pop` or `apply` a stash*
```sh
gcmp stash HEAD
```
**It answers:** "How does my stashed work differ from the current state of my branch? Will applying it cause major conflicts?"

---

#### 5. Compare Two Branches
*Essential for code reviews or pre-merge checks*
```sh
gcmp main feature-branch
```
**It answers:** "What changes has `feature-branch` introduced compared to `main`?"

---

#### 6. Compare Current State vs. an Old Version
```sh
gcmp work v1.2.0
```
**It answers:** "How does my current work differ from the `v1.2.0` release?"

---

#### 7. Compare Two Historical Commits
*Useful for debugging a code regression*
```sh
gcmp abc123d def456a
```

---

#### 8. Compare Within a Specific Repository
```sh
gcmp ~/projects/my-app main develop
```

## üîß Customization

### Changing the Diff Tool

By default, `gcmp` uses `bcompare`. You can change this to your preferred tool by editing the `DIFF_TOOL` variable at the top of the script.

```bash
# gcmp.sh

# --- Global Configuration ---
# You can change this to your favorite diff tool command
DIFF_TOOL="bcompare" 
```

Some popular alternatives:
*   **Visual Studio Code**: `DIFF_TOOL="code --diff"`
*   **KDiff3**: `DIFF_TOOL="kdiff3"`
*   **Meld**: `DIFF_TOOL="meld"`
*   **P4Merge**: `DIFF_TOOL="p4merge"`

Ensure your chosen tool's command is in your system `PATH` and that it supports receiving two directory paths as arguments for comparison.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1.  **Parse Arguments**: The script first determines the repository path and the two references (`ref1` and `ref2`) from the command-line arguments.
2.  **Create Temporary Environment**: It creates a unique temporary directory (e.g., `/tmp/git-compare-XXXXXX`) and sets a `trap` command to ensure this directory is automatically deleted when the script exits (whether on success, failure, or interruption).
3.  **Export Content**:
    *   For `work`, it uses `git ls-files` to list all tracked files and `rsync` to efficiently copy them into a temporary subdirectory. This ensures only Git-managed files are compared.
    *   For `stage`, it uses `git checkout-index`, the most direct and accurate method for exporting the staging area to a directory.
    *   For all other Git references (commits, branches, tags, stashes), it uses `git archive` to export the complete file tree of that reference into a temporary subdirectory.
4.  **Launch Diff Tool**: It passes the two populated temporary subdirectories to your configured `DIFF_TOOL`. The script uses a `-wait` flag (if supported) to pause until you close the diff tool.
5.  **Automatic Cleanup**: Once you close the diff tool, the script resumes, and the `trap` command is triggered on exit, completely removing all temporary files and directories.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Dependencies & Requirements

*   `bash` (v4.0+ recommended)
*   `git`
*   A graphical directory comparison tool (e.g., [Beyond Compare](https://www.scootersoftware.com/), [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Meld](http://meldmerge.org/), etc.) with its executable in your system `PATH`.
